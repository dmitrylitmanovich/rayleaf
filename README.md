# 🌿 Rayleaf — A Lighter Web of Connection

Rayleaf is a federated social platform for people who want meaningful, private, and values-based communication — without corporate surveillance, ad feeds, or algorithmic manipulation.

We believe in decentralization, consent, clarity, and quiet rebellion.

### 💡 Why Rayleaf?

Most social networks are built for engagement.  
Rayleaf is built for **alignment** — with your values, your rhythm, your communities.

We prioritize:

- 🔐 **Encrypted DMs & Private Groups**
- 🧩 **Modular Identity** (use one or many)
- 🌎 **Federated instances** with shared intent
- 💭 **Self-reflection mode** (journal-style drafts, mood check-ins)
- 🫂 **Micro-communities** within each instance
- ⏳ **Time-limited & self-destructing posts**
- 🌱 **Local-first posting** with sync
- 🧭 **Values-based discovery**
- 🌐 **Reputation & trust graph** (opt-in)

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Golang + Fiber, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Nix shells
- **Frontend**: Flutter (mobile-first), React (web client)
- **Architecture**: Modular microservices with strict boundaries
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, privacy-by-default
- **Deployment**: Docker, CI/CD pipelines, flake-based NixOS support
